###Emotions to invoke:###

In this project, I wanted to invoke a feeling of pleasantness, accessability and spark the adventure-nerve in the user.

###How the project will achieve this:###

* By providing a non-cluttered webpage, the information and contact should be displayed clearly. As a large percentage of users start their webpage journey by scrolling down to the end of the page to read the contact-info, I put a link to my contact.html (Contact Us page) in the footer. 
* Implementing the golden ratio as much as possible for the call-to-action buttons and visuals to make the eye-cathing parts stand out even more. 
* The colors used were mostly in the blue hue spectrum, to create a unified image. 
* The blue hues also invokes trust and calmness in the user. One may think that a burst of orange and yellow would be great for a person who seeks out adventure, however Härjedalen is a very serene place. The calmness of the nature and sturdy mountains surrounding you is the feeling I want to give the user.
* A responsive page as with mobile-first in mind.
* The fonts used: Montserrat is an easy to read font and was therefore used as the main text. Special Elite got a more gritty look and more structure and personality to it, just as nature itself and hence, was used for the headings.

###User stories:###

* I want to call the site for more information, I go to the footer.
* As a user, I want to find season-based articles as my vacation days are planned during that time. I go to the nav.
* I need to contact the site-owner to gain more info. I use the nav.
* I'm interested in what the visit/what to do articles are describing. I use the CTA button.
* I want to see if there's any social links, I go to the footer.
* By clicking the CTA button on the Contact Us page, I want to fill out a short form.

###Wireframes:###


##Features##
--------------------------------------------

###Nav-bar:###

Easy and clean navigation bar to use.

###CTA buttons:###

The call-to-action buttons provides valueable links to the user which leads them to more information outside the page. All CTA-buttons is provided with target=_blank, so the user doesn't leave the webpage.

###Modal:###

By not having a regular form, with a lot of other things on the page that might distract a modal was included to make it easy to fill in the valueable information that the site-owner want to recieve.


##Features Left to Implement##
--------------------------------------------

* A CSS mask for the page-title to make a flowy heading to the page, leaving a good first impression.
* Modals for the pictures in the summer and winter pages where a short description of the linked page is described. 
* Reviews of the webpages the site is linking to, as the user tend to want an easy and fast choice.

##Technologies Used##
--------------------------------------------

###Languages:###
For this project, I've used HTML5 and CSS3 and JS in HTML.
The frameworks used include:

####Bootstrap:#### https://getbootstrap.com/ 
Bootstrap was used especially for the nav, grid, modal and buttons. 
They were used for their non-clutterness and efficiency to the project.

####Font Awesome:#### https://fontawesome.com/
Font Awesome was used for all of the icons to provide a unified image for the webpage.

###Libraries:###

####Hover.css:#### https://cdnjs.com/libraries/hover.css
Hover was used for the beautiful and easy-to-use hover effects to make the webpage more responsive.


##Testing##
--------------------------------------------

1. Contact form: Try to fill out the email input with an unvalid email gives an error message.

2. CTA: All provided links work.

3. The webpage has been tested for responsiveness in tablet and mobile size.

4. Tested on Chrome, Explorer and Firefox.

##Deployment##
--------------------------------------------

Visual Studio Code was used for the coding and used git push to an existing repo on github. 
Then I chose the master branch for the github pages which provides a link to the project.
To run it on github, write python3 -m http.server in the termial, expose and then open the browser.
